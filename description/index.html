sequence, in other words, it mimicks std::vector interface. You can
insert, delete elements at random positions, as well as access them

it inserts/deletes elements at random positions for O(log(N)) time.

<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">What conclusions can be
made? If you are definitely sure that your application uses mostly
iterative/random access, use std::vector. (I.e., you perform
&quot;container.resize()&quot;, then use [] or iterators). But if you
use random insertions/deletions (erase_if, for example), you should
prefer btree_seq.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">btree_seq performs random
insertions/deletions better on all sizes of container.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If you use btree_seq
instead of vector by mistake, you can loose at most log(n) times,
which is not so crucial. However, if you use vector instead of
btree_seq by mistake, you can loose n/log(n) times   and that is
crucial. So, if you are not sure, use btree_seq.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is a method of
sequential access, which is even faster than access using iterators
(by a constant factor, roughly 1.25-1.3). It is visiting.</P>

the interval or until visitor returns true first time. This technique
can be used for summation of sequences or for finding the first
element with a given criterium. However, if you don't want to
implement a visitor or if you make operation with two or more
sequences, use iterators.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are two cycles. The
outer cycle iterates over the depth of the tree. The variable depth
(class member) determines how many levels of branches between the
root and leaves (it is the same for all leaves, because tree is
balanced) and determines, how to interpret children: as Leaf* or as
Branch*. If depth==0, the tree contains only one leaf (or no elements
at all and no nodes), if depth==1, the tree contains one branch with
leaves and so on.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The inner cycle iterates
over numbers of elements in subtrees and enters the appropriate one.
The variable pos contains the number of elements remained before
desired element.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Let us look at little
example: we need an element #11.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Large cycle - iteration #1
(node=branch 7-6-6, j=depth=2, pos=11). We start from the root and
iterate over the branch 7-6-6. The first subtree contains 7 elements,
so element #11 is not there. We updete pos=11-7=4. Two elements
remained until the desired element is reached. The next subtree
contains 6 elements and we enter that subtree, because 6&gt;4.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Large cycle - iteration #2
(node=branch 3-3, j=1, pos=4). We skip subtree HIJ, because it
contains 3 elements and update pos=4-3=1. We enter next subtree,
because 3&gt;1.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Final statements of the
function. We exit main cycle, because j=0. Now node points to the
Leaf KLM and pos=1. We return these values to the caller, and the
resulting element is L (element #1 in the Leaf KLM).</P>

<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If we need to delete or
insert some elements, you need only to update the corresponding Leaf
and increment or decrement some values in the branches. For example,
if you want to erase element L, you update the Leaf KLM so that it
becomes KM, the branch 3-3 so that it becomes 3-2 and root branch so
that it changes from 7-6-6 to 7-5-6. If you insert or delete one
element, you typically update only one value at each level (unless
overflow or underflow is performed). That's why all modifications
take O(log(N)) time.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There are following
restrictions for the number of elements and children:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">1) each leaf must have
from M/2 to M elements, unless it is the only leaf in the tree;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">2) if the whole tree

<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">3) all branches except
root have from L/2 to L children;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">4) root branch contains
from 2 to L children.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If these rules are broken
during modification process, leaves and branches are balanced,
merged, splitted; tree depth is incremented or decremented.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">These rules also guarantee
that the tree will consume not very much memory, if the tree is large
enough.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__1476_1425840264"></A>Discussion:
why fat leaves and fat branches are efficient.</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The simplest tree is
binary tree. Each branch contains up to two children, each node
contains only one element. (Various algorithms for balancing exist,
such as red-black tree.)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Now consider we have a
tree of 1000 elements. To access an element, we need to visit 10
nodes. If the nodes are scattered randomly in the memory, we perform
10 accesses of random memory locations.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Modern computers load big
amounts of data from the outer memory to the cache. The typical
length of the cache line is 128 bytes. If you access a value, they
load some amount of memory near that value. If your tree have fat
leaves and fat branches, each branch fits into the cache line.
Suppose you have a tree of 1000 elements. If L=30, M=60, the tree
have only two levels. If you access an element, you only access
memory at two random locations.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The discussion above is
true for both sequential trees and map trees. One of example of maps
based on binary tree is called red-black tree. Maps based on fat
trees are called b-trees. There is an implementation of sequential
tree with fat leaves and binary branches, it's called
__gnu_cxx::rope. This implementation uses fat leaves and branches and
outperforms rope roughly 10 times.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">However, leaves and
branches must not be too fat. If they are too fat, much time is
necessary to insert or delete element at random place.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">You can choose your
parameters L and M depending on the target platform and operations
your application uses most of all.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The parameters are
restricted: L&gt;=4, M&gt;=4. (Default values L=30, M=60).</P>

leaf. Basically, it behaves like vector: it moves elements when
insertion or deletion is needed, random access is very fast in this
case, because you don't need to travel down the tree. Insertions and
deletions are performed faster than in vector in this case, because
no reallocation is necessary. However, the whole leaf is allocated
even for one element, so if your application uses many containers of
small size, set L and M to small values.</P>

details of short insertion: one-pass operation.</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Short insertion is
performed when the precise number of elements is known a-priori and
this number is less or equal M/2.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In this case, either
elements are inserted into existing leaf, or one leaf is splitted and
then elements are inserted into one of new leaves.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The algorithm travels
through the tree and makes two things at the same time: updates the
num values in the branches and finds the required leaf. (Alternative
implementation can be: two-pass algorithm - find the leaf first, then
travel back and increment the num values, or, even worse, recursive
implementation is possible, which requires many calls/returns.) Then,
if necessary, leaves are splitted, elements are inserted into the
proper place, and, if leaves were splitted, overflow procedure is
performed.</P>

details of large insertions: inserting multiple leaves at a time.</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Large insertion is
performed when the precise number of elements is unknown (for example
using non-random access iterators) or the number of elements is
greater than M/2. 
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We suppose that many
leaves will be inserted. (In the special case, if the tree is empty,
we initialize it, so the tree has at least one leaf.) First, we split
the leaf at the place of insertion, if the insertion place is in the
middle of the leaf. Then, we fill the left leaf in the place of
insertion until it is full. Then we fill and insert into the tree
bundles of L-1 leaves. Finally, we check for underflow condition if
the last inserted leaf or a leaf next to it or both have less
elements than required.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__1486_1425840264"></A>Implementation
details of erasing, cleaning and visiting: one-pass, recursion only
if necessary.</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I implemented erasing
operation and visit operation using the same engine. Destructor and
clean operation use erase(0,count) as well. Here, I describe only
erase operation, visit operation behaves similarly. Erase operation
involves recursion only if necessary. If one element is erased, no
recursion is involved at all; if the whole contents is erased,
recursion is used on the whole contents.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The erase operation is
implemented as following. Firstly, if the range of deletion
completely located in only one subtree, we go into that subtree
completely, decreasing the number of elements in that subtree by the
way. (If the all erased elements are in one leaf, neither recursion
nor two-pass operation is performed.) Then, if the range of deletion
is located in two or more subtrees, we use cycle and call the erase
procedure recursively. Finally, if we reached the leaf, we erase
elements of the leaf and the leaf itself if necessary. After all
elements are deleted, underflow condition is checked.</P>

details of iterator: lazy iterator and dereference operation.</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">I met the most complicated
dilemma when I implemented the iterator.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Most applications will
probably use old std::vector style of insertion/deletion like
container.erase(container.begin()+3,container.begin()+6) instead of
native interface container.erase(3,6), and will use iterator when it
is not really necessary to use the iterator. If I implemented the
iterator in non-lazy way, the iterator &quot;container.begin()+3&quot;
would actually point to the third element, it would require iterator
to pass down the tree actually and the whole call would require at
least three passes, no matter how I implemented them.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Instead, I implemented
lazy iterators. They do not actually point to the elements of the
container until the moment they are dereferenced. If they are used as
parameters to &quot;erase&quot; or &quot;insert&quot; calls, they
never point to the actual elements and are used only as wrappers to
size_t.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">An iterator contains value
called abs_idx (the absolute position in the container) in it, as
well as rel_idx (relative index in the current leaf) as well as some
other data. Operations like increment or changing position just
change the values of abs_idx and rel_idx, but don't check whether
rel_idx really points to the actual data. Comparison and substraction
operations comapre snd substract abs_idx. Dereference operations
check, whether rel_idx points to the correct value and, if necessary,
 update the rest variables of the iterator, so that it points to the
required element.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The update iterator is
written in such way, that it takes almost constant time amortized, if
the iterator is used for sequential access. I say &quot;almost
constant time&quot;, because it takes C1*log(N)+C2, and the constants
are such, that C2 is much more than C1*log(N) even if iterator
contains 2**64 elements. I could implement the iterator in the way
that it required honest constant time, but it would be slower
practically.</P>
